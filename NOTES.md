# Notes

This is a collection of notes and some interesting things I found while combing through this.

## Notes notes

- This is a makeshift tool. I don't like to query the app store over and over again for data because I don't want to be a douche and/or get rate limited.

- Use Command/Control + Shift + V in VSCode to open a markdown file in preview mode (try it out now). All the data that's out from `./functions` is in markdown and properly formatted so it's easier to comb through data.

## Interesting

- Partner URLs are created even if you don't have apps on the app store, so _if I am correct_, the Partner count you get when you run `npm run start` is the actual number of partners signed up for the Partner program.

- Apps that are _unlisted_ on the App Store still get indexed in the sitemap, so sometimes you'll just end up finding competition before they even launch.
