# App Store Scripts

A make shift collection of scripts to work with data from App Store's sitemap and more (in the future).

Everything in the repo is meant to be used for educational purposes only.

## Why I built this

I regularly like to run checks on what's happening in the App Store and without scraping it unnecessarily. This means respecting baseline standards on what it means to analyze data and do your own research.

## Notes

- Read [SETUP](./SETUP.md) to see how to setup and use.
- Read [NOTES](./NOTES.md) for notes.
